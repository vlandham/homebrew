Homebrew
========

Another Linux port of homebrew. 

Similar to [rubiojr's version][rubiojr] in setup, but based on a newer version of homebrew (post 0.8).

Plans are to use this specifically for managing bioinformatic packages.
This will replicate much of [bio.brew][biobrew] but will be in ruby and thus not as terrible to deal with.

Please use the official [homebrew repository][mxcl] if a bio-based Linux port is not interesting to you.

Thanks to Max Howell for providing such a great tool!
